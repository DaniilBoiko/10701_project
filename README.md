# Building a news recommender system

This is a project for the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" (10-701) at Carnegie Mellon University.

Before starting set the enivorment variable:
```bash
export MINDPATH="../"
```

## File description

- **train_classifier.py** is the main file for training the classifier
- **train_classifier_gpu.py** is the main file for training the classifier on GPU
- **train_classifier_embeddings.py** is the main file for training the classifier on GPU with USE embeddings

Additional experiments:
- **positional_bias_study.py** calculates ctr's for different page positions

Advanced metric calculation:
- **approximate_dates.py** calculates dates of first impression for the news articles, thus approximating their publication dates
- **additional_metrics_computation** contains classes to compute the metrics
- **use_unaware_amc_example** shows how to use the advanced metric calculation classes to compute the metrics
- **use_aware_amc_example** shows how to use the advanced metric calculation classes to compute the metrics

Flask app:
- **app.py** is the main file for the flask app
- **templates/** contains the html templates for the flask app

Utils:
- **utils.py** contains utility functions
- **text_utils.py** contains utility functions for text processing
- **get_USE_embeds_colab.ipynb** is a notebook for getting USE embeddings from colab

Data files:
- **news2dates.pkl** contains the mapping from news article ids to their publication dates (approximated)
- **model.json** the best ranking model
- **config.yaml** the config file for the best ranking model
- **vectorizer.pkl** the vectorizer for the best ranking model

Plots:
- **aware_diversities.png** the diversity plot for the user-aware model
- **aware_novelties** the novelty plot for the user-aware model
- **ctr.png** the ctr plot â€” positional bias study
- **diversity.png** the diversity plot for the user-unaware model
- **pca.png** the pca plot for the USE embeddings
- **novelty.png** the novelty plot for the user-unaware model
